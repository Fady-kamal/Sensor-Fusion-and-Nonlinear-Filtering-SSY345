# Sensor-Fusion-and-Nonlinear-Filtering-SSY345

This repository is for the course "Sensor Fusion and Nonlinear Filtering (SSY345)" at the Chalmers University of Technology.

The repository contains the code and the report for all the home assignments and the final project.

## Home Assignment 1

Assignment 1 deals with the transformation of Gaussian random variables, **MMSE**, and **MAP** estimates for Gaussian mixture posteriors and conditional densities and their relation to joint densities. Furthermore, the assignment investigates the machinery behind the Bayesian measurement updates for Gaussian densities in detail.

## Home Assignment 2

Assignment 2 explores various aspects of the Kalman filter and its tuning.
