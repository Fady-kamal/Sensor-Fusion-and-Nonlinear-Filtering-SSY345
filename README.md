This repository is for the course "Sensor Fusion and Nonlinear Filtering (SSY345)" at the Chalmers University of Technology.

The repository contains the code and the report for all the hand-in assignments and the final project.

## Assignment 1

Assignment 1 deals with the transformation of Gaussian random variables, **MMSE** and **MAP** estimates for Gaussian mixture posteriors and conditional densities and their relation to joint densities. Furthermore, the assignment investigates the machinery behind the Bayesian measurement updates for Gaussian densities in detail.

## Assignment 2

Assignment 2 explores various aspects of Kalman filter and its tuning.
